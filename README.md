# SugarCoat Pipeline

SugarCoat is a tool that allows filterlist authors to automatically patch JavaScript scripts to restrict their access to sensitive data according to a custom privacy policy. Check out the [blog post](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/12-sugarcoat/) and [paper](https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sugarcoat-ccs-2021.pdf)!

This repo is an implementation of the SugarCoat pipeline. It uses [pagegraph-crawl](https://github.com/brave-experiments/pagegraph-crawl) to crawl a given website and generate PageGraph graphs, [pagegraph-rust-cli](https://github.com/brave-experiments/pagegraph-rust/tree/main/pagegraph-cli) to get JavaScript script sources that match adblock rules from the generated graphs, and [sugarcoat](https://github.com/brave-experiments/sugarcoat) for the actual patching of JavaScript scripts. 

You can specify which sensitive Web APIs to block access to in `policy.json` ([example](https://github.com/brave-experiments/sugarcoat-pipeline/blob/main/policy.json)). All SugarCoat pipeline output is generated in `output/` by default (can be changed via CLI argument). Patched scripts go in `output/sugarcoated_scripts` and the generated EasyList-style filter rules in `output/sugarcoat_rules.txt`.

## Setup

1. Git clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brave-experiments/sugarcoat-pipeline
cd sugarcoat-pipeline
```

2. You need the [Rust and Cargo toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) setup in order to use the SugarCoat pipeline. The `pagegraph-rust-cli` Rust binary is built using Cargo as part of the post-installation phase. 

3. To install the NPM dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Note that the minimum Node version required is `14.18.1`.

4. You will also need a working PageGraph binary (an instrumented version of the Brave browser) to crawl the website you want to sugarcoat and generate `.graphml` files that are then analyzed for scripts. You can [build a binary following the wiki instructions](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/PageGraph), or you can download one for Intel Macs from the [Release page here](https://github.com/brave-experiments/sugarcoat-pipeline/releases/latest). Remember to unzip it! Alternatively, on the command line:

#### For Mac
```bash
# Download the latest Mac Intel zip (and follow redirect)
curl -L https://github.com/brave-experiments/sugarcoat-pipeline/releases/latest/download/pagegraph-mac-intel.zip -o pagegraph-mac-intel.zip
unzip pagegraph-mac-intel.zip
rm pagegraph-mac-intel.zip
```

5. (optional) You will need a local copy of a filter list - you can get the latest copy of the easylist filterlist [here](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt), easyprivacy [here](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt) or uBlockOrigin Unbreak [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/master/filters/unbreak.txt). Alternatively, there's copies in the repo. 

```bash
curl -s https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt -o easylist.txt
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/master/filters/unbreak.txt -o unbreak.txt
curl -s https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt -o easyprivacy.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
npm run sugarcoat-pipeline  -- -b <PATH_TO_PAGEGRAPH_BINARY> -u <URL> -t <SECS_TO_RUN_PAGEGRAPH> -l <FILTERLISTS>
```
The filterlists can be space-separated i.e. `-l easylist.txt unbreak.txt`. 

### Example:

#### For Mac
```bash
npm run sugarcoat-pipeline  -- -b pagegraph-mac-intel.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave\ Browser\ Development   -t 10 -l easylist.txt unbreak.txt easyprivacy.txt -o output -u https://metacritic.com 
```
(note that on macOS the binary has to be the executable under the `.app`).

Now check `output/` (is auto-generated).

### Help
```bash
$ npm run sugarcoat-pipeline  -- -h

> sugarcoat-pipeline@0.1.0 sugarcoat-pipeline
> node sugarcoat-pipeline.js "-h"

usage: sugarcoat-pipeline.js [-h] [-b BINARY] [-u URL] [-t SECS] [-d] -l FILTER_LISTS [FILTER_LISTS ...] [-p POLICY] [-o OUTPUT] [-g GRAPHS_DIR_OVERRIDE] [-k] [-r RETRIES] [-m] [-s]
